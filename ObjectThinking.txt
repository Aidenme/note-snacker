class Book
init self, link
	self.link = link
	self.title = self.getTitle(link)
	self.HTMLFile = self.getHTMLFile()
	self.highlights = []

Book should only exist if there is a link. Basically "if link found" book should be and local html file should be. 

Then have a list of books.

get all books

Book(link)

Can't get highlight count on init because you can't get the highlight count without opening the actual link. init should not do that because it will take a long time to just do that basic stuff.
